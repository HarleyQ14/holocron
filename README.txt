Repository structure
 origin/master
	-> builds
		- This will hold test/release builds
	-> src
		- The root of the unity source code 
		(NOTE: This structure will hold any assest that are used by the game - we may want some sort of top level assets folder to hold non-game related assets,
		or assets that we *may* want to use but are not currently part of the project.)
